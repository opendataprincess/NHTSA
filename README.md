#Other notes about this data
DUI, Not wearing a seatbelt, distracted driving, speeding, hitting a deer, fatigue and atmospheric conditions are all factors contributing to safety while in an automobile.
One claim of a state safety vehicle inspection program is to reduce automobile fatalities. According to a 2015 GAO Report, the inspection program in remaining states may not be doing that: http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672131.pdf

NHTSA does not list fatalities by distracted driving by state but rather gives a total in the U.S. of 3179. To approximate how much this would be by state, I multiplied by a factor of 0.09729 (Distracted Driving Total U.S. divided by Total U.S. Fatalities). It's also important to note I listed the potential lives saved by wearing restraint devices as estimated by the NHTSA. However, this number was not included in the calculation since you cannot assume potential lives saved by wearing safety restraints = fatalities by not wearing safety restraints.

NJ discontinued safety inspection program 08/01/2010 |
DC ended safety inspection program 10/1/2009

Total fatalities in this dataset is different from total crashes since there can be more than 1 person involved in each crash.
