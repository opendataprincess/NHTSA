#Other notes about this data
DUI, Not wearing a seatbelt, distracted driving, speeding, hitting a deer, fatigue and atmospheric conditions are all factors contributing to safety while in an automobile.
One claim of a state safety vehicle inspection program is to reduce automobile fatalities. According to a 2015 GAO Report, the inspection program in remaining states may not be doing that: http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672131.pdf

NJ discontinued safety inspection program 08/01/2010 |
DC ended safety inspection program 10/1/2009

Total fatalities in this dataset is different from total crashes since there can be more than 1 person involved in each crash.
